Docker compose for creating localrepo centos 7

Case scenario:
If your production environment has no Internet because of regulations, then this better alternative to get depedencies.

# docker volume details:
home/  -- shared with container /root 
logFile/  -- shared with container /var/log

# For start:
'''sh
mkdir home
mkdir logFile
docker-compose run centos bash
'''
# for add more tty to running centos (container):
'''sh
$ docker ps
'''
Then check the current running CONTAINER ID (should with NAMES: docker-centos_centos_1)
$ docker exec -ti $CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash

# downlad the depedencies:

this git contain example-install.sh just move to home dir, and run it inside your container
the script install: git, nginx, and php
you can add more by adding in script file OR
you can use yumdownloader inside bash container

# note:

all file generated by container owned by root:root.
you can change it via command in your host tty / primary OS
'''sh
# chown -R $USER:$USER home/
'''
